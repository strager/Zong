# Software Architect Review - Zong Programming Language

## Persona Description
As a Software Architect with 15+ years of experience in language design and compiler architecture, I focus on high-level system design, scalability, maintainability, and architectural patterns. I evaluate whether the codebase follows sound architectural principles and can evolve sustainably.

## Architecture Assessment

### Overall Architecture Analysis
The Zong compiler follows a classical multi-phase compiler architecture:
1. **Lexical Analysis** - Token generation from source
2. **Parsing** - AST construction using precedence climbing
3. **Code Generation** - Direct AST-to-WASM compilation

**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns between lexing, parsing, and code generation
- Well-defined AST representation with clear node types
- Precedence climbing parser is appropriate for expression parsing
- Direct WASM backend eliminates need for intermediate representations

**Architectural Concerns:**
- **Monolithic Design**: Everything lives in a single `main.go` file (1784 lines)
- **Global State**: Lexer relies heavily on global variables (`input`, `pos`, `CurrTokenType`, etc.)
- **Tight Coupling**: Parser and code generator are tightly coupled to specific AST structure
- **Limited Extensibility**: Adding new language features requires modifications across multiple functions

### Scalability Assessment
**Current State**: Adequate for experimental phase but concerning for long-term growth.

**Scaling Challenges:**
1. **File Size**: Single 1784-line file will become unwieldy as features expand
2. **Global State**: Makes concurrent compilation impossible and complicates testing
3. **Type System**: Current TypeNode system is basic - will need significant expansion
4. **Memory Management**: No clear strategy for memory management features mentioned in specs

### Modularity Analysis
**Critical Issues:**
- No package structure beyond single main package
- Functions are not grouped by responsibility
- WASM generation code mixed with general AST utilities
- No clear interfaces or abstractions

**Recommended Modularization:**
```
zong/
├── lexer/          # Lexical analysis
├── parser/         # Parsing logic and AST
├── types/          # Type system
├── codegen/        # Code generation
├── wasm/           # WASM-specific utilities
└── runtime/        # Runtime support
```

### Design Pattern Analysis
**Current Patterns:**
- **Visitor Pattern**: Partially implemented in `EmitStatement`/`EmitExpression`
- **Factory Pattern**: Limited use in type creation
- **Global State Pattern**: Overused in lexer

**Missing Patterns:**
- **Strategy Pattern**: For different code generation targets
- **Builder Pattern**: For complex AST construction
- **Observer Pattern**: For compiler passes and diagnostics

### Technical Debt Assessment
**High Priority Issues:**
1. **Architectural Debt**: Monolithic structure prevents parallel development
2. **Global State Debt**: Makes testing and concurrency difficult
3. **Type System Debt**: Current system won't scale to advanced features
4. **Error Handling Debt**: Panic-based error handling is insufficient

**Medium Priority Issues:**
1. Lack of compiler passes framework
2. No intermediate representation for optimization
3. Limited diagnostic and error reporting
4. No symbol table or scope management

### Self-Hosting Readiness
**Current Status**: Not ready for self-hosting due to:
- Limited language features (only I64 type, basic expressions)
- No module system
- No advanced control flow
- No memory management primitives

**Self-Hosting Requirements:**
1. Complete type system (structs, arrays, pointers)
2. Module/import system
3. Advanced control flow (match/switch, iterators)
4. Memory management operations
5. Standard library framework

### Future Architecture Recommendations
**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- Refactor into separate packages
- Remove global state from lexer
- Implement proper error handling system
- Add symbol table and scope management

**Phase 2 (Medium term):**
- Add intermediate representation layer
- Implement compiler passes framework
- Design extensible type system
- Add optimization infrastructure

**Phase 3 (Long term):**
- Multi-target code generation
- Advanced static analysis
- Incremental compilation support
- Language server protocol support

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk:**
- Technical debt accumulation will slow feature development
- Global state makes concurrent compilation impossible
- Monolithic structure prevents team scaling

**Medium Risk:**
- Current type system may need complete rewrite
- WASM-only target limits platform support
- No clear upgrade path for existing code

### Conclusion
While the current architecture successfully demonstrates core compiler functionality, it faces significant scalability challenges. The monolithic design and global state patterns must be addressed before adding substantial new features. However, the core algorithms (precedence climbing, direct WASM generation) are sound and provide a solid foundation for refactoring.

**Priority**: Architectural refactoring should be the next major milestone before implementing additional language features.
